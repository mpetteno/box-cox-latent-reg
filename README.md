# Latent Space Regularization via Normalizing Attribute Transformations for Symbolic Music Generation

A repository containing the code developed for my masterâ€™s thesis in the Music and Acoustic Engineering (MAE) program 
at Politecnico di Milano. The project makes use of the [Resolv](https://github.com/resolv-libs) libraries to generate 
the dataset and train the models. The dataset is currently available on 
[Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13369389).
