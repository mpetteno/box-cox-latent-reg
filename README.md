# On the Joint Minimization of Regularization Loss Functions in Explicit Latent Variable Models for Symbolic Music Generation

A repository containing the code for the article "On the Joint Minimization of Regularization Loss
Functions in Explicit Latent Variable Models for Symbolic Music Generation" that will be soon publicly available.
The project makes use of the [Resolv](https://github.com/resolv-libs) libraries to generate the dataset and train the models. 
The dataset is currently available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13369389).
