# On the Joint Minimization of Regularization Loss Functions in Deep Variational Bayesian Methods for Attribute-Controlled Symbolic Music Generation

This repository contains the code for the paper **On the Joint Minimization of Regularization Loss
    Functions in Deep Variational Bayesian Methods for Attribute-Controlled Symbolic Music Generation**,
    submitted to [EUSIPCO 2025](https://eusipco2025.org/) and currently under review.

The project makes use of the [Resolv](https://github.com/resolv-libs) libraries to generate the dataset and train the models. 

The dataset is currently available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13369389).
